# Simple Factory
Simple factory pattern, also known as static factory method pattern, it belongs to the class
creation pattern. In the simple factory pattern, you can return instances of different
classes based on different parameters. The simple factory pattern specifically defines a
class to be responsible for creating instances of other classes, and the created instances
usually have a same parent class.
Strictly speaking, the simple factory pattern is not actually a design pattern, it looks
more like a kind of coding habit.
